# Feature Specification: Simple Web App

**Feature Branch**: `001-simple-web-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Simple web application with a single web page that contains: center all content on the page; a title at the top of the page \"Simple Web App\"; two blank lines; a subtitle \"Echo Input\"; text input box with a label \"Enter Text\" with a button next to it that has caption \"Echo\", the button is colored blue with white text; below the \"Enter Text\" input text box, output text box to contain the results when the \"Echo\" button is clicked; two blank lines; place a horizontal line separator; two blank lines; a subtitle \"Simple Calculator\"; Two text input boxes, labeled \"X\" and \"Y\", respectively; below the two text boxes, place 4 buttons, respectively captioned with \"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\", buttons are colored green with white text; below the four buttons place an output text box with the label \"Results\". Functional requirements: echo input and simple calculator operations."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Render single-page UI with centered content
2. User enters text in "Enter Text" input and clicks "Echo"
   ‚Üí UI updates Echo output with: "YOU ENTERED: <user text>"
3. User enters numeric values into X and Y inputs
4. User clicks one of the calculator buttons (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
   ‚Üí Validate inputs are numbers
   ‚Üí Perform selected arithmetic operation
   ‚Üí Display result in "Results" output
5. Handle invalid inputs with a clear error message in the Results output
6. Return SUCCESS when interactions work as specified
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no frameworks or tech stack mandated)
- üë• Written for stakeholders and testers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want a small single-page app where I can echo arbitrary text and perform simple arithmetic on two numbers so I can quickly verify inputs and calculations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the page is open, **When** the user enters "hello" in "Enter Text" and clicks "Echo", **Then** the Echo output shows: `YOU ENTERED: hello`.
2. **Given** the page is open, **When** the user enters `3` into `X`, `4` into `Y` and clicks `add`, **Then** the Results output shows `7`.
3. **Given** non-numeric input in `X` or `Y`, **When** a calculator button is clicked, **Then** the Results output shows an error message describing the invalid input.
4. **Given** division by zero (`Y = 0`) and user clicks `divide`, **When** operation is attempted, **Then** the Results output shows an appropriate error like `Error: Division by zero`.

### Edge Cases
- Empty echo input should display `YOU ENTERED:` with an empty string (still valid).
- Leading/trailing whitespace in inputs should be trimmed before processing.
- Very large numbers: display result or an error if operation overflows numeric precision.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Page MUST center all content on the page.
- **FR-002**: Page MUST display a top title: "Simple Web App".
- **FR-003**: Page MUST include a subtitle "Echo Input" followed by a labeled input `Enter Text` and a blue `Echo` button with white text to its right.
- **FR-004**: When `Echo` is clicked, the app MUST set the Echo output box value to `YOU ENTERED: <input>`.
- **FR-005**: A horizontal rule MUST separate the Echo section and the Calculator section.
- **FR-006**: Page MUST include a subtitle "Simple Calculator" with two labeled inputs `X` and `Y`.
- **FR-007**: Page MUST include four green buttons with white text labeled `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide` placed below the two inputs.
- **FR-008**: When a calculator button is clicked, the app MUST validate that `X` and `Y` are parseable as numbers and perform the corresponding operation, then display the result in the `Results` output box.
- **FR-009**: Division by zero MUST be handled and surface an error message in the `Results` output box.

### Key Entities
- **User Input**: Plain text from `Enter Text` field.
- **Numeric Inputs**: `X` and `Y` values used for arithmetic operations.
