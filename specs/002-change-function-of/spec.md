# Feature Specification: Change function of "Add" button

**Feature Branch**: `002-change-function-of`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "change function of \"add\" button\n- If \"X\" and \"Y\" fields are both numeric, compute the arithmetic sum\n- If either \"X\" or \"Y\" or both are string, concatenate \"X\" and \"Y\" fields."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the application, when I enter values into the X and Y fields and press the "Add" button, the application should either compute the numeric sum when both inputs are numeric, or concatenate the values when either input is a string. The action should be predictable and documented in the UI.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** X = 2 and Y = 3 (both numeric), **When** the user clicks "Add", **Then** the result shown is 5 (numeric addition).
2. **Given** X = "foo" and Y = "bar" (both strings), **When** the user clicks "Add", **Then** the result shown is "foobar" (string concatenation).
3. **Given** X = 2 and Y = "3" (mixed types), **When** the user clicks "Add", **Then** the result shown is "23" (concatenate, because at least one input is string).
4. **Given** X = "2" and Y = 3 (mixed types), **When** the user clicks "Add", **Then** the result shown is "23" (concatenate).
5. **Given** X or Y is empty or missing, **When** the user clicks "Add", **Then** show an error.

### Edge Cases
- Very large numeric values and potential overflow concerns: No special handling.
- Inputs containing numeric-looking strings (e.g., "03", " 5 "): specify trimming and numeric parsing rules.
- Inputs with leading/trailing whitespace: should be trimmed before type determination.
- Non-ASCII characters in strings.
- Inputs that are objects, arrays, or other types (if applicable): Issue error message "Invalid input".

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow the user to enter values into `X` and `Y` input fields and trigger an action via the "Add" button.
- **FR-002**: When both `X` and `Y` are numeric (after trimming whitespace and parsing), the system MUST compute and return their arithmetic sum as a numeric value.
- **FR-003**: When either `X` or `Y` (or both) are non-numeric strings, the system MUST return the concatenation of `X` and `Y` as a single string, preserving the input ordering (X followed by Y).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST document the behavior in the UI or help text so users understand how mixed types are handled.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST handle common edge cases consistently (leading/trailing whitespace, empty inputs), with the following policies:
  - If either `X` or `Y` is empty or missing, the system MUST display an error message indicating that both fields are required.
  - Leading and trailing whitespace in inputs MUST be trimmed before type determination.
- **FR-006**: Results MUST be displayed in the same location/format as current behavior (unless changed by further requirements).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Input Field `X`**: A single value provided by the user; treated as text for input capture, with downstream parsing to determine numeric vs string.
- **Input Field `Y`**: Same as `X`.
- **Result**: The output of the "Add" action, either a numeric value (sum) or a string (concatenation).
