# Implementation Plan: Dynamic Web Page

**Branch**: `003-dynamic-web-page` | **Date**: September 27, 2025 | **Spec**: `/Users/jim/Desktop/genai/hello_spec_kit/specs/003-dynamic-web-page/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/jim/Desktop/genai/hello_spec_kit/specs/003-dynamic-web-page/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Create a dynamic web page with static top section (title, Echo/Compute buttons) and dynamic bottom section that changes based on button clicks. Echo function displays input field and returns "YOU ENTERED: " + user text via `/api/echo` endpoint. Compute function displays calculator interface with X/Y inputs and operation buttons that call either `/api/add` (for string concatenation) or `/api/calculate` (for mathematical operations) endpoints. All backend logic implemented in Flask with React frontend making REST API calls.

Technical approach: Build Flask backend with three REST endpoints (`/api/echo`, `/api/add`, `/api/calculate`) that handle business logic. React frontend provides dynamic UI that switches between Echo and Compute interfaces, handles user input validation, and displays results or error messages from backend API responses.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+ for backend, Node.js with React for frontend  
**Primary Dependencies**: Flask for backend REST API, React for frontend UI, requests for REST API calls from frontend, pytest for backend testing  
**Storage**: N/A (no persistent storage required - stateless application)  
**Testing**: pytest for backend testing, npm test for frontend testing  
**Target Platform**: macOS local development environment  
**Project Type**: Web application - Node.js React frontend + Python Flask backend  
**Performance Goals**: Reasonable responsiveness for local single-user application (no specific performance targets)  
**Constraints**: Desktop-only fixed width layout, Flask development server, local execution only  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user local web application with 3 backend endpoints and 2 frontend interface modes  

**Dependency Management**: Backend dependencies via pip in requirements.txt, frontend dependencies via npm package.json

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Checks performed against the repository constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`):
- Constitution file contains template placeholders only - no specific project principles defined
- Applying general software engineering best practices: test-first development, clear separation of concerns, maintainable code structure
- Project structure: separate frontend/backend with clear API contracts - supports testability and modularity
- Testing approach: pytest for backend unit/contract tests, npm test for frontend component tests
- No specific constitutional violations identified given template state

Result: PASS - no constitutional violations detected. Project follows standard web application patterns with appropriate separation of concerns.

**Structure Decision**: Web application using existing repository structure with Flask backend in `src/` and React frontend served as static assets from `src/static/`. Tests organized by type following established patterns in the repository.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md)
- Each API endpoint contract → contract test task [P]
- Each data model entity → model implementation task [P]
- Each user story from quickstart → integration test task
- Implementation tasks organized by TDD principles (tests first, then implementation)

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Contract Tests** (3 tasks): test_echo_contract.py, test_add_contract.py, test_calculate_contract.py
2. **Backend Models** (2 tasks): Request/Response models, validation logic
3. **Backend Services** (3 tasks): Echo service, Add service, Calculate service  
4. **Backend API** (1 task): Flask app with endpoint routing
5. **Frontend Components** (4 tasks): App component, Echo interface, Compute interface, API service
6. **Integration Tests** (7 tasks): One per user story from quickstart scenarios
7. **Setup/Config** (2 tasks): Requirements.txt updates, package.json setup

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Unit tests → Implementation → Integration tests
- Dependency order: Models → Services → API endpoints → Frontend components
- Backend before frontend (API must exist for frontend to consume)
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where tasks are independent

**Estimated Output**: 22 numbered, ordered tasks with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
