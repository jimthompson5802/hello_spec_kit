# Research: Dynamic Web Page

**Feature**: Dynamic Web Page  
**Date**: September 27, 2025  
**Research Phase**: Phase 0 - Technical Research and Decision Documentation

## Research Questions and Findings

### Flask Backend Architecture
**Decision**: Use Flask with Blueprint-style organization for API endpoints  
**Rationale**: Flask provides lightweight REST API capabilities suitable for local development. Blueprint organization allows clean separation of echo, add, and calculate endpoints while maintaining simplicity for a single-user application.  
**Alternatives considered**: FastAPI (overkill for local app), Django (too heavyweight), direct HTTP server (lacks framework conveniences)

### React Frontend Integration
**Decision**: Serve React app as static assets from Flask's static folder with build process  
**Rationale**: Simplifies deployment to single Flask server while maintaining React development workflow. React provides component-based UI perfect for dynamic interface switching between Echo and Compute modes.  
**Alternatives considered**: Separate React dev server (adds complexity), Vanilla JS (more manual DOM manipulation), Server-side rendering (unnecessary for SPA)

### API Design Pattern
**Decision**: RESTful endpoints with JSON request/response format  
**Rationale**: Standard pattern for frontend-backend communication. Clear separation of concerns with predictable interface contracts. JSON provides easy serialization for mixed string/numeric data types.  
**Alternatives considered**: GraphQL (overkill), WebSocket (not needed for request-response), Form data (less flexible for mixed types)

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: HTTP status codes + structured JSON error responses  
**Rationale**: Standard HTTP semantics (400 for bad input, 200 for success) with consistent error message format enables frontend to display user-friendly error messages in Results/Output boxes.  
**Alternatives considered**: Custom status codes (non-standard), HTML error pages (not suitable for API), Exception throwing without handling (poor UX)

### Testing Approach
**Decision**: Contract tests for API endpoints, unit tests for business logic, integration tests for UI flows  
**Rationale**: Contract tests ensure API behavior matches frontend expectations. Unit tests verify calculation/echo logic. Integration tests validate complete user scenarios from button clicks to result display.  
**Alternatives considered**: Only integration tests (too slow for development), Only unit tests (misses API contract issues), Manual testing only (not maintainable)

### Frontend State Management
**Decision**: React component state for UI mode switching and form data  
**Rationale**: Simple application with minimal state (current mode, input values, results). Component state sufficient without additional complexity of Redux or Context API.  
**Alternatives considered**: Redux (overkill for simple state), Context API (unnecessary for component-local state), Vanilla JS DOM manipulation (more error-prone)

### Development Workflow
**Decision**: Flask development server for backend, npm build process for React compilation  
**Rationale**: Flask dev server provides hot reload for Python changes. npm build compiles React JSX into browser-compatible JavaScript served as static assets.  
**Alternatives considered**: Production WSGI server (unnecessary for development), webpack dev server (adds complexity), No build process (limits React features)

## Architecture Decision Record

**Context**: Need dynamic web interface with backend business logic  
**Decision**: Flask REST API + React SPA architecture  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Consequences**: 
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Testable API contracts  
- ✅ Modern UI development experience
- ❌ Slightly more complex than server-side rendering
- ❌ Requires build process for frontend

## Next Phase Requirements

All technical unknowns resolved. Ready for Phase 1 design with:
- API endpoint specifications 
- Data model definitions
- Contract test scaffolding
- Component interface design
