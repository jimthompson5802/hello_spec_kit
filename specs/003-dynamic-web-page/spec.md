# Feature Specification: Dynamic Web Page

**Feature Branch**: `003-dynamic-web-page`  
**Created**: September 27, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Dynamic Web Page with User Interface definition for a simple web application with a single web page that contains a top part and bottom separator with centered content, featuring Echo and Compute functions with dynamic display based on button clicks."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: Web application with static top section and dynamic bottom section
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: web page layout, button interactions, echo functionality, calculator functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All major aspects clearly defined in user description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flows clearly defined for both Echo and Compute functions
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Input data, calculation results, echo responses
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details included, focused on user requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user visits a simple web application and can interact with two main functions: an Echo function that repeats back text they enter, and a Compute function that performs basic mathematical calculations on two numbers. The interface dynamically changes based on which function the user selects.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is on the web page, **When** they click the "Echo" button, **Then** the bottom section displays an input field with "Enter Text" label and an "Echo Input" button
2. **Given** the Echo interface is displayed, **When** the user enters text and clicks "Echo Input", **Then** the output box displays "YOU ENTERED: " followed by the entered text
6. **Given** the Echo interface is displayed with empty text input, **When** the user clicks "Echo Input", **Then** the output box displays "Please enter text" error message
3. **Given** the user is on the web page, **When** they click the "Compute" button, **Then** the bottom section displays a calculator interface with X and Y input fields and four operation buttons
4. **Given** the Compute interface is displayed with numeric values in X and Y fields, **When** the user clicks any operation button (add, subtract, multiply, divide), **Then** the calculation result appears in the Results output box
5. **Given** the Compute interface is displayed with text values in X or Y fields, **When** the user clicks the "add" button, **Then** the text concatenation result appears in the Results output box

### Edge Cases
- When user enters non-numeric values in calculator fields for subtract, multiply, or divide operations, system displays "Invalid input" error message in Results box
- When division by zero is attempted, system displays "Cannot divide by zero" in Results box
- When switching between Echo and Compute functions, all input fields and results are cleared to provide clean interface

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a static top section with "Simple Web App" title, "Echo" and "Compute" buttons, and a horizontal separator
- **FR-002**: System MUST center all content on the web page with fixed width layout optimized for desktop computers
- **FR-003**: System MUST display Echo interface in bottom section when "Echo" button is clicked, replacing any previous content and clearing all input fields
- **FR-004**: System MUST display Compute interface in bottom section when "Compute" button is clicked, replacing any previous content and clearing all input fields
- **FR-005**: System MUST process echo requests when user enters text and clicks "Echo Input" button, displaying "YOU ENTERED: " followed by the input text in the output box
- **FR-013**: System MUST display "Please enter text" error message in output box when "Echo Input" button is clicked with empty text input field
- **FR-014**: System MUST use fixed width layout designed specifically for desktop computer screens
- **FR-006**: System MUST perform mathematical calculations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) when numeric values are provided in X and Y fields
- **FR-007**: System MUST perform text concatenation when "add" button is clicked and either X or Y contains string values
- **FR-011**: System MUST display error message "Invalid input" in Results box when non-numeric values are entered for subtract, multiply, or divide operations
- **FR-012**: System MUST display "Cannot divide by zero" in Results box when division by zero is attempted
- **FR-008**: Echo input button MUST be styled with blue background and white text
- **FR-009**: Calculator operation buttons MUST be styled with green background and white text
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain proper spacing with two blank lines between major interface sections

### Key Entities
- **User Input**: Text or numeric values entered by users in various input fields
- **Echo Response**: The formatted text that gets returned and displayed when echo function is used, prefixed with "YOU ENTERED: "
- **Calculation Result**: The numerical or text result from mathematical operations or string concatenation
- **Interface State**: The current display mode (Echo or Compute) of the dynamic bottom section

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: When users enter invalid data (like non-numeric values for subtract/multiply/divide operations), how should the system respond? ‚Üí A: Display error message in Results box (e.g., "Invalid input")
- Q: How should the system handle division by zero in the calculator? ‚Üí A: Display "Cannot divide by zero" in Results box
- Q: What should happen when users switch between Echo and Compute functions multiple times? ‚Üí A: Clear all input fields and results when switching
- Q: What should happen when a user clicks the "Echo Input" button but the text input field is empty? ‚Üí A: Display "Please enter text" error message
- Q: Should the web application work on mobile devices (phones/tablets) or only desktop computers? ‚Üí A: Desktop only - fixed width layout
